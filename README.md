# Protein Recognition Index (PRI)

![](docs/sources/images/pri-logo.png)

The Protein Recognition Index (PRI) measures the similarity between H-bonding features in a given complex (predicted or designed) and the characteristic H-bond trends from crystallographic complexes based on hydrogen-bond interactions idendified by [Hbind](https://github.com/psa-lab/Hbind) (software for rigorously defining intermolecular H-bonds by donor/acceptor chemistry and geometric constraints).

The PRI was developed, used, and described in detail in
