## Installation

No installation is required to execute the Protein Recognition Index software, which is available from the `code` subdirectory in this repository: [`./code/pri-score.py`](https://github.com/rasbt/protein-recognition-index/blob/master/code/pri-score.py). However, a current version of Python is required; we recommend [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) or greater.

In addition, running `pri-score.py` requires hydrogen-bond interaction tables as generated by [Hbind](http://psa-lab.github.io/Hbind). Hbind is freely available, and for more information on how to install and use it, please visit [http://psa-lab.github.io/Hbind](http://psa-lab.github.io/Hbind).
